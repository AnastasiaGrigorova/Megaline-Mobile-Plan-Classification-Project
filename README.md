# Megaline Mobile Plan Classification Project

In this project, I worked on helping Megaline, a mobile carrier, optimize their service offerings by building a machine learning model to recommend the best plan for their subscribers. Megaline discovered that many of their customers were still using outdated plans, so I set out to create a model that could predict whether a subscriber should switch to one of the newer plans: Smart or Ultra.

I started with a dataset that contained behavior data for subscribers who had already switched, including information on their monthly call patterns, text usage, and internet traffic. After completing initial data preprocessing, I moved straight into the modeling phase. I experimented with several classification algorithms, fine-tuning them to achieve an accuracy of at least 0.75, which was the defined threshold.

In the end, I successfully developed a model that met the accuracy requirements and provided Megaline with a reliable tool for recommending the optimal plan based on each subscriber's usage behavior.
